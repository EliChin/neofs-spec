# Introduction

## Overview

\Gls{NeoFS} is a decentralized distributed object storage system integrated with [Neo Blockchain](https://neo.org).

\Glspl{Node} are organized in peer-to-peer network that takes care of storing
and distributing user's data. Any Neo user may participate in the network and
get paid for providing storage resources to other users or store his data in
NeoFS and pay a competitive price for it.

Users can reliably store object data in the NeoFS network and have a transparent
data placement process due to decentralized architecture and flexible storage
policies. Under the users we mean both individuals and enterprises. Each
\Gls{Node} is responsible for executing the storage policies that the users
select for geographical location, reliability level, number of nodes, type of
disks, capacity, etc. Thus, NeoFS gives full control over data to users.

Deep [Neo Blockchain](https://neo.org) integration allows NeoFS to be used by
\glspl{dApp} directly from
[NeoVM](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/technology/neovm.html) on the
[Smart
Contract](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/technology/neocontract.html)
code level. This way dApps are not limited to on-chain storage and can
manipulate large amounts of data without paying a prohibitive price.

NeoFS has native [gRPC](https://grpc.io) \Gls{api} and popular protocol gates
such as [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html),
[HTTP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol),
[FUSE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) and
[sFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) allowing
developers to easily integrate their applications without rewriting their code.

Using this set of features, it's possible, for example, to have dApp's Smart
Contract to manage monetary assets and data access permissions on NeoFS and let
users access that data using a regular Web Browser or mobile application.
